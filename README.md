## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) - Local development server
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project taught me alot as I decided not to use any npm packages. Below are some:

- How to create a lightbox
- Creating a sidenav
- Creating a cart functionality including adding and removing items
- Improving image load times
  among others

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Doc](https://www.tailwindcss.com/docs) - This helped me in styling the entire webpage and theres no saying how much I have come to love Tailwind.
- [Event Bubbling and even catching in JavaScript and React](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/event-propagation-event-bubbling-event-catching-beginners-guide/#what-is-event-delegation) - This is an amazing article by [Mariya Diminsky](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/mariya-diminsky/) which helped me finally understand event bubbling and why my parent onclick event was firing too. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept or trying to figure it out.
